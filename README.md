In general good work , you implement what you were asked.

I also like that you handle the clean-up after it.

Improvement points:

Give a basic instruction on how to execute it and what this script is doing.

You put secrets (like AWS SECRET etc) that not need to be as a plain text in git. You can use it as ENV varible etc.

Could add try-catch blocks for boto3 operations.
